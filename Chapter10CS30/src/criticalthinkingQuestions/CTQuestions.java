//1) GUIs are designed based computer programming that allows users to interact with computer applications via 
//symbols and other visual representations.

//2) Event driven applications have a general event loop that detects for changes in events (the code)  
//and then notifies a call back function so that specific event can process and perform.  

//3) Components within a GUI frame can freely be added as long as a special layout is set. 
//This layout is called absolute layout. 

//4) Labels cannot  respond to events because they are not user input components.

//5) GUIs are swing based programs. Which means they're designed for single-threaded usage. 
//Normal threads can process for more than 1 intended use. But that also makes them unsafe for these types of programs.
//So, the event-dispatching thread was created to present GUIs programmed with swing based methods.   

//6) Labels are used to display messages or prompts 
//where buttons can be clicked by the user to perform some sort of task
